#This program was written to take a dump of files that had roll numbers in their file name (but not in any order). 
#The files had to be segragated into a set of preset folders. The mapping of file to folder was maintained in a mapping file

# get working directory and store it
mypath <- getwd()

#List all the docx files in the folder
file_names <- list.files(paste0(mypath,"/Midterm/"), pattern="*.docx", full.names=TRUE)

#Read the list of students and sections into a data frame
RefList <- read.table(paste0(mypath,"/SectionList.txt"), sep=",",
                      col.names=c("Student", "Section"))


#Read one file name at a time, look for roll no and move to relevant section
for (i in 1:NROW(file_names))
{
  for(j in 1:nrow(RefList))
  {
    if(grepl(RefList$Student[j], file_names[i]))
    {
      output_file <- paste0(mypath,"/",RefList$Section[j],"/",RefList$Student[j],".docx")
      file.copy(from = file_names[i], to = output_file)
      file.remove(file_names[i])
      break
    }
  }
}
#When program ends, all files should get segregated into sections as per Section List
